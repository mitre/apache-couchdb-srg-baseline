    This requirement applies to situations where security data is retrieved or
modified via data manipulation operations, as opposed to via specialized
security functionality.

    In an SQL environment, types of access include, but are not necessarily
limited to:
    SELECT
    INSERT
    UPDATE
    DELETE
    EXECUTE

    Review the CouchDB documentation to verify that audit records can be
produced when security objects are accessed.

    if line does not exist or is commented out, this is a finding.

    #grep \"level =\" <path to default.ini>
    if line does not exist or is not set to info, this is a finding.

this is a finding.

    Configure CouchDB to set to log audit records when security objects are
accessed.
