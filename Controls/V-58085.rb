access security objects occur."
  desc  "Changes to the security configuration must be tracked.

    This requirement applies to situations where security data is retrieved or
modified via data manipulation operations, as opposed to via specialized
security functionality.

    In an SQL environment, types of access include, but are not necessarily
limited to:
    SELECT
    INSERT
    UPDATE
    DELETE
    EXECUTE

    To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in
addition to the successful ones.

    Review the CouchDB database documentation and deployed configuration to
verify that the database is configured to log audit records forunsuccessful

    # grep \"file =\" <path to default.ini>
    if line does not exist or is commented out, this is a finding.

    #grep \"level =\" <path to default.ini>
    if line does not exist or is not set to info, this is a finding.
