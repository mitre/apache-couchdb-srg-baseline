  title "The DBMS must be able to generate audit records when
privileges/permissions are retrieved."
  desc  "Under some circumstances, it may be useful to monitor who/what is
reading privilege/permission/role information. Therefore, it must be possible
to configure auditing to do this. DBMSs typically make such information
available through views or functions.

    This requirement addresses explicit requests for privilege/permission/role
membership information. It does not refer to the implicit retrieval of
privileges/permissions/role memberships that the DBMS continually performs to
determine if any and every action on the database is permitted.

     Check CouchDB settings and documentation and be able to generate audit
records when privileges/permissions are retrieved.

    if line does not exist or is commented out, this is a finding.
    #grep \"level =\" <path to default.ini>
    if line does not exist or is not set to info, this is a finding.

    If it is not set to generate audit records when privileges/permissions are
retrieved, this is a finding.
