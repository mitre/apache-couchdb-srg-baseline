    Review DBMS configuration to verify DBMS user accounts are being mapped
directly to unique identifying information within the validated PKI certificate.

    To check the cn of the certificate, using openssl, do the following:

    # openssl x509 -noout -subject -in client_cert

    If the cn does not match the users listed in CouchDB and no user mapping is
used, this is a finding.

    If user accounts are not being mapped to authenticated identities, this is
a finding.

    If the cn and the username mapping do not match, this is a finding.
