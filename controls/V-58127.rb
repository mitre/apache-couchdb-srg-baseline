  desc  "Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions against
changes to configuration, it would be difficult to identify attempted attacks
and an audit trail would not be available for forensic investigation for
after-the-fact actions.

    Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent
unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may
be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file
permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions
blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact.
