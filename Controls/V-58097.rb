access categories of information (e.g., classification levels/security levels)
occur."
  desc  "Changes in categories of information must be tracked. Without an audit
trail, unauthorized access to protected data could go undetected.

    To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in
addition to the successful ones.

  desc  'check', "
    Review the CouchDB database documentation and deployed configuration to
verify that the database is configured to log audit records for when
unsuccessful attempts to access categories of information (e.g., classification
levels/security levels) occur.

    # find . -name \"default.ini\"
    # grep \"file =\" <path to default.ini>
    if line does not exist or is commented out, this is a finding.

    #grep \"level =\" <path to default.ini>
    if line does not exist or is not set to info, this is a finding.

    If it is not set to log  when unsuccessful attempts to access categories of
information (e.g., classification levels/security levels) occur, this is a
finding.

    Configure CouchDB to generate audit records  when unsuccessful attempts to
