functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by
default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations
(e.g., key missions, functions).

    It is detrimental for software products to provide, or install by default,
functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives.

    DBMSs must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing
only essential capabilities.
