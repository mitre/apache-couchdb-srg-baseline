added."
  desc  "Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and
roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or
restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users
access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted
privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users.

    In an SQL environment, adding permissions is typically done via the GRANT
command, or, in the negative, the DENY command.
