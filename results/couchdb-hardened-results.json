This requirement guards against adverse or unintended system behavior\ncaused by invalid inputs, where information system responses to the invalid\ninput may be disruptive or cause the system to fail into an unsafe state.\n\n    The behavior will be derived from the organizational and system\nrequirements and includes, but is not limited to, notification of the\nappropriate personnel, creating an audit record, and rejecting invalid input.\n\n    This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require\ncollaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many\ncases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the\napplication developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code.\nNevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation\nof databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt\nto obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been\naddressed, and must document what has been discovered.\n  \"\n  desc  \"check\", \"\n    Review system documentation to determine how input errors are to be handled\nin general and if any special handling is defined for specific circumstances.\n\n    Review the source code for database program objects (stored procedures,\nfunctions, triggers) and application source code to identify how the system\nresponds to invalid input.\n\n    As database administrator, make a small syntax error:\n    Example command:\n    GT /_all_dbs\n     Verify the syntax error was logged:\n     # find . -name \\\"default.ini\\\"\n        # grep \\\"file =\\\" <path to default.ini>\n              if line does not exist or is commented out, this is a finding.\n     #grep \\\"level =\\\" <path to default.ini>\n              if line does not exist or is not set to info, this is a finding.\n\n\n    If it does not implement the documented behavior, this is a finding.\n  \"\n  desc  \"fix\", \"\n    Configure CouchDB to generate audit records for all invalid inputs.\n    # find . -name \\\"default.ini\\\"\n    # set level = info\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag \"severity\": \"medium\"\n  tag \"gtitle\": \"SRG-APP-000447-DB-000393\"\n  tag \"gid\": \"V-58183\"\n  tag \"rid\": \"SV-72613r2_rule\"\n  tag \"stig_id\": \"SRG-APP-000447-DB-000393\"\n  tag \"fix_id\": \"F-63391r1_fix\"\n  tag \"cci\": [\"CCI-002754\"]\n  tag \"nist\": [\"SI-10 (3)\", \"Rev_4\"]\n\n\n  describe ini(input('couchdb_conf_default')) do\n    its('log.level') { should eq 'info'}\n  end\n\nend\n","source_location":{"line":3,"ref":"C:/Users/zhangc/git/apache-couchdb-srg-baseline/controls/V-58183.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"passed","code_desc":"INI /opt/couchdb/etc/default.ini log.level is expected to eq \"info\"","run_time":0.0002305,"start_time":"2020-08-10T11:24:48-04:00"}]},{"id":"V-61407","title":"If DBMS authentication, using passwords, is employed, the DBMS must\nenforce the DoD standards for password complexity and lifetime.","desc":"OS/enterprise authentication and identification must be used\n(SRG-APP-000023-DB-000001).
