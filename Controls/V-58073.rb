privileges/permissions occur."
  desc  "Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles
granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail,
unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected.

    In an SQL environment, adding permissions is typically done via the GRANT
command, or, in the negative, the DENY command.

    To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in
addition to the successful ones.
