  title "The DBMS must protect the confidentiality and integrity of all
information at rest."
  desc  "This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity
of information at rest in non-mobile devices and covers user information and
system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when
it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive)
within an organizational information system. Applications and application users
generate information throughout the course of their application use.

    User data generated, as well as application-specific configuration data,
needs to be protected. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms
to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate.

    If the confidentiality and integrity of application data is not protected,
the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.
  "
  desc  'check', "
    Review DBMS settings to determine whether controls exist to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of data at rest in the database.

    CouchDB does not encrypt data at rest other than passwords.

    If the application owner and Authorizing Official have determined that
encryption of data at rest is NOT required, this is not a finding.

    If disk or filesystem requires encryption, ask the system owner, DBA, and
SA to demonstrate the use of disk-level encryption. If this is required and is
not found, this is a finding.

    If controls do not exist or are not enabled, this is a finding.
