    Review the access permissions to tools used to view or modify audit log
configurations. These tools may include features within CouchDB itself or
software external to the database.

    Logging configuration is defined in the default.ini configuration file and
other .ini files. Only ISSM (or individuals or roles appointed by the ISSM)
should have permission to write to the file.

    Verify the permission of the .ini files with the following commands:

      # find . -name \"*.ini\"
      # ls -la <path of .ini file>

    If any of these .ini files give write permissions to any user other than
ISSM (or individuals or roles appointed by the ISSM), this is a finding.
